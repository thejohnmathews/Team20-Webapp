Follow these Instructions to setup you're local repo if you nuke and re-clone it. 

1. Setup Mirrored Github: 
	git remote set-url --add --push origin https://S24-Team20@dev.azure.com/S24-Team20/S24-Team20/_git/S24-Team20
	git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/thejohnmathews/Team20-Webapp.git
	** Run "git remote show origin" to double check 
	
	the above command should have this snippit:
	Fetch URL: https://S24-Team20@dev.azure.com/S24-Team20/S24-Team20/_git/S24-Team20
  	Push  URL: https://github.com/thejohnmathews/Team20-Webapp.git
  	Push  URL: https://S24-Team20@dev.azure.com/S24-Team20/S24-Team20/_git/S24-Team20

4. Install react-scripts if not installed:
	npm install react-scripts

5. npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

6. Use the amplify pull command listed under our app in Amplify
-  Will be under backend Backend Environments -> Local Setup Instructions 


7. npm start will work locally now

Other Issues I came across: 
- Need to change access to a few folders (it will tell you the folders)
- Some errors give you linux commands to run 
- Otherwise, pray its an easy fix or chatgpt has the answers
